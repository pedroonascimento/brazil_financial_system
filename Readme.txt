
This is a readme document for the Brazil_Financial_System repository, in Github.

The purpose of this document is to explain the author's intention with the app and the R code. The Shiny app is a repository, to facilitate
users to find the most important financial information about Brazil - interest rate, inflation, credit balance and concession in the system, etc.

First, the data source is Brazil's Central Bank, which consolides all the financial information from Brazil, which it usually updates 
one month after the month of reference. The Shiny app is automatically updated, whenever new information arrives in the Central Bank's system.

On the first sheet, the data is referred to the consolidated financial system, showing the balance outstanding of credit in the system. Also, the 
concession of credits in the system - new origination, the percentage of credits past due, which could turn into defaults, the country's basic 
interest rate and inflation, the average interest rate of the operations in the system and also the interest rate of these operations.

On the second sheet, the data is referred to the consolidated financial system, but broken down in consumer and corporate information, 
showing the balance outstanding of credit in the system, by group. Also, the concession of credits in the system - new origination by group, 
the percentage of credits past due by group, which could turn into defaults,the average interest rate of the operations in the system by group
and also the interest rate of these operations, by group.

The next steps are including more market information.
